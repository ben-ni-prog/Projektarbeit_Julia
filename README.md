# Projektarbeit-Julia
Interaktive SQLite Datenbank mit anbindung an eine Webpage zur erstellung einer To-Do-Liste fÃ¼r eine Mensa
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Install
To run the program, please install the following packages:

add Genie

add GenieFramework

add Inflector

add JSON

add SQLite

add DataFrames

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# General Info
This web app has been generated using Julia and the Genie.Generator package with the newapp_webservice() function. 
The package documentation can be found here: 
https://docs.juliahub.com/Genie/8eazC/1.7.2/API/generator.html

The webpage has been designed with the GenieFrameworks package:
https://genieframework.com/
https://docs.juliahub.com/General/Genie/stable/

For the database the packages SQLite and DataFrames have been used:
https://juliadatabases.org/SQLite.jl/stable/
https://docs.juliahub.com/DataFrames/AR9oZ/0.21.5/


To start the Programm, please follow the next steps:
1. run the file app.jl
2. in the terminal, enter:
   
        using Genie

        Genie.loadapp()

        up()
   
3. open the following link in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The modified files are restricted to the app.jl file and db_setup.jl file in the db folder. db_setup is used to create and connect to a SQLite database. app.jl contains all the code for design and usability of the webpage.
Further functionalities and detailed explanations for these can be found within the files, respectively.

You
in the following julia code using the GenieFramework package i am displaying two links to other pages. Please change the code in a way that these links are displayed in separate lines: 
route("/") do
    [ h4("Welcome to the number analysis module"),
      a("Numbers form", href="/form"),
      a("Reactive Form", href="/reactive")
    ]
end


Copilot: Sure, I can help with that. In Julia, you can use the br() function from the GenieFramework to add a line break between the links. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code:
route("/") do
    [ h4("Welcome to the number analysis module"),
      a("Numbers form", href="/form"),
      br(),
      a("Reactive Form", href="/reactive")
    ]
end
In this modified code, br() creates a line break, which will display the links on separate lines. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

Can i do this?: SQLite.execute(db, "UPDATE Tasks SET status = '1' WHERE task=df_selection.task, author=df_selection.author, date=df_selection.date")
Copilot
Usingthe web
The SQL query youâ€™re trying to execute seems to be trying to update a row in the Tasks table where the task, author, and date match those of df_selection. However, it appears youâ€™re trying to use Julia variables directly in a SQL query, which wonâ€™t work as expected.
You should use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and to correctly format the variables. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
Julia
using SQLite

#Assuming `db` is your SQLite database connection and `df_selection` is your DataFrame
SQLite.execute(db, "UPDATE Tasks SET status = '1' WHERE task = ? AND author = ? AND date = ?", (df_selection.task, df_selection.author, df_selection.date))
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In this code, the ? are placeholders that SQLite will replace with the values from the tuple (df_selection.task, df_selection.author, df_selection.date). This ensures that the values are correctly formatted and safely inserted into the SQL query.
Please replace df_selection.task, df_selection.author, and df_selection.date with the actual values you want to use.
Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
